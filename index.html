        <h1>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Jonathan Clement, a soon-to-be graduate from Clayton State University with a passion for technology and problem-solving. 
            My focus lies in database concepts like modeling, design, and querying, where I enjoy creating efficient and scalable solutions. 
            Recently, I’ve expanded my skillset into web design and development through volunteer work with Securus House, a local domestic violence shelter, where I redesigned their website to enhance accessibility and functionality.
        </p>

        <p>    
            In addition to my academic achievements, I bring hands-on experience from roles in robotics, CAD, and even automotive repair, showcasing my versatility and commitment to tackling challenges across various domains. 
            Whether it’s optimizing databases, coding innovative solutions, or building user-friendly websites, I thrive on turning ideas into reality.
