        <h1>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Jonathan Clement, a soon-to-be graduate from Clayton State University with a passion for technology and problem-solving. 
            My focus lies in database concepts like modeling, design, and querying, where I enjoy creating efficient and scalable solutions. 
            Recently, I’ve expanded my skillset into web design and development through volunteer work with Securus House, a local domestic violence shelter, 
            where I redesigned their website to enhance accessibility and functionality.

                <h3>Website Redesign for Local DV Shelter</h3>
                <p>I collaborated with a local domestic violence shelter to redesign their outdated website. Over several months of meetings and revisions, I developed a new site from scratch, retaining key design elements from the original. The new website includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Donation Payments:</strong> A seamless system for collecting donations online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Galleries:</strong> Showcasing photos from their activities and events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Integration:</strong> Direct links to their profiles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Information:</strong> Detailed sections outlining their initiatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact & Volunteer Forms:</strong> Fully digitized and functional forms for inquiries and volunteer submissions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project is an ongoing effort to ensure the site meets their evolving needs.</p>

                <h3>Food Truck Web Application</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created for a class assignment, with the objective of designing a webpage for a fictional food truck. The website featured several key functionalities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Order Management:</strong> Customers could place orders, receive order numbers, and track their orders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Location Services:</strong> Integrated to display the truck's daily locations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Order Ahead:</strong> Customers had the ability to pre-order food.</li>
                    <li><strong>Admin Features:</strong> Truck owners could log in to update inventory and cancel unclaimed orders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> A local database was used to manage orders and track inventory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrated both front-end and back-end development skills, highlighting the seamless integration of functionality with user needs.
