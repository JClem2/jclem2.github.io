        <h1>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Jonathan Clement, a soon-to-be graduate from Clayton State University with a passion for technology and problem-solving. 
            My focus lies in database concepts like modeling, design, and querying, where I enjoy creating efficient and scalable solutions. 
            Recently, I’ve expanded my skillset into web design and development through volunteer work with Securus House, a local domestic violence shelter, 
            where I redesigned their website to enhance accessibility and functionality.

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My journey began with a curiosity about how cars operate, which led to developing my own mechanic skills and working professionally as an automotive technician for a year. 
            This hands-on problem-solving approach taught me how to quickly pick up new concepts, a lesson that transitioned seamlessly into the world of programming and technology.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            In addition to my time as a mechanic, I spent five years working in an industrial metal shop, where I mastered precision and attention to detail as a PEM Operator and apprentice machinist. 
            These experiences provided a strong grounding in technical systems and a meticulous approach to my work.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            Over the past two years, I’ve applied these principles to technology projects at Clayton State University’s Robotics Laboratory, developing innovative solutions like an automated drone platform and programmable bipedal robots. 
            My work has been showcased at the CSU CIMS Symposium in both 2023 and 2024, where I presented these projects on stage. 
            I’ve also contributed to inspiring the next generation of technologists, collaborating with the Department Head to run summer camps for middle and high school students focused on Data Science and AI.
        </p>    
        <p>
            For me, learning is always at the forefront of my journey. 
            Whether it’s understanding a car engine, designing database solutions, or programming innovative systems, I thrive on tackling complex problems and turning ideas into reality.
